Quickscripts
============

As the name implies, these are some quick command-line scripts that I've written.  Hopefully their uses are mostly self-explanatory.  By putting these into a repository, I hope to move some of these away from quick hacks and closer towards more user-friendly software.

Dependencies
------------
- [Python 3](http://python.org)

- Most need my [waterworks](https://github.com/dmcc/waterworks) library

- Some need others -- each file should list any extra dependencies

License
