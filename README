As the name implies, these are some quick command-line scripts that I've written.  Hopefully their uses are mostly self-explanatory.  By putting these into a repository, I hope to move some of these away from quick hacks and closer towards more user-friendly software.

Dependencies
------------
- Python: http://python.org (these generally only require less-up-to-date versions since some of these needed to run on machines with older installations)

- Most need my waterworks library: https://bitbucket.org/dmcc/waterworks or https://github.com/dmcc/waterworks

- Some need mx.DateTime: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/egenix-mx-base/
