As the name implies, these are some quick command-line scripts that I've written.  Hopefully their uses are mostly self-explanatory.
By putting these into a repository, I hope to move some of these away from quick hacks and closer towards more user-friendly software.

Dependencies
------------
- Python (generally older versions since some of these needed to run on machines with older installations

- Most need my waterworks library: https://bitbucket.org/dmcc/waterworks

- Some need mx.DateTime
